Great ‚Äî that link (http://20.193.252.33/public/) shows your Laravel project, but it's not the correct or secure way to serve a Laravel app. The public/ folder should not be part of the URL ‚Äî it should be the server's root.

# ‚úÖ Your Goal:
When visiting `http://20.193.252.33`, it should <b>automatically' load Laravel‚Äôs homepage, not </b> show directory listings or require `/public/`.

# üîê Why this matters:
<ul>
  
  <li>
    Exposing the whole Laravel project (via http://20.193.252.33/) is a security risk.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    You should serve only the contents of the public/ folder via the web.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    The rest of the Laravel framework should be hidden from public access.
  </li>
  
</ul>

# üîß How to Fix (Apache):

Follow these steps carefully:

```bash

sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf



```
Update this section:

```apache

DocumentRoot /var/www/html/laravel_project/public




```

Replace laravel_project with your actual Laravel folder name.

  Example:
  If you uploaded Laravel directly into /var/www/html/, then:

```apache
DocumentRoot /var/www/html/public


```

# 2. (Optional) Disable Directory Listing

Also in the same file, inside the `<Directory>` block, make sure you have:


```apache
<Directory /var/www/html/public>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>


```

Remove Indexes if you want to hide folder listings:

```apache

Options FollowSymLinks


```

# 3. Enable Apache Rewrite Module

```bash
sudo a2enmod rewrite


```

# 4. Restart Apache

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2

```

# ‚úÖ Now, try accessing:
http://20.193.252.33
It should load your Laravel project without needing `/public/`.

# üîê Final Security Tip:

Make sure permissions are set correctly:

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html


```

Let me know if you're using Nginx instead of Apache, or if you want me to generate the config file content for you.


# setup all the permissons correctly
download and upload the project_permissions.sh file into your server. And after that run the below commands into the terminal :

create a new file as project_permissions.sh and into this write the code below and upload it into the server or download the project_permissions.sh file and upload it into the server :

```sh
#!/bin/bash

PROJECT_PATH="/var/www/html"  # Change if your path differs
USER="triodev"                # Replace with your VPS user
WEBGROUP="www-data"

echo "Fixing Laravel permissions in $PROJECT_PATH..."

sudo chown -R $USER:$WEBGROUP $PROJECT_PATH
sudo find $PROJECT_PATH -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
sudo find $PROJECT_PATH -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
sudo chmod -R ug+rwx $PROJECT_PATH/storage $PROJECT_PATH/bootstrap/cache

echo "‚úÖ Permissions fixed successfully!"

# chmod +x project_permissions.sh
# ./project_permissions.sh
```

After that run these two commands into the terminal of the `vps server`, Here are the commands :

```bash

chmod +x project_permissions.sh
./project_permissions.sh

```
