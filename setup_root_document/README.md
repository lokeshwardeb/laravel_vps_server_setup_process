`on the root server i have uploaded the laravel software, when open it, it shows all the files and directories, and and when open the /public folder under it, then it shows the project`

You're seeing Laravel's files and folders listed in the browser because the server is serving from the wrong root directory.

# ðŸš¨ Problem:
Your web server (Apache or Nginx) is pointing to /var/www/html/ (or wherever you uploaded Laravel), but it should only serve the /public folder of Laravel â€” not the entire project.

# âœ… Correct Setup for Laravel on a VPS
Your serverâ€™s DocumentRoot (Apache) or root (Nginx) should be:

```
/var/www/html/laravel_project/public

```
Instead of:

```
/var/www/html/laravel_project
```

# ðŸ”§ Solution for Apache
Open your Apache config file:

```
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
```

Change the DocumentRoot to:

```
DocumentRoot /var/www/html/laravel_project/public
```
Replace laravel_project with your actual folder name.

Save and exit.

# Set the correct permissions (optional but recommended):

```
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/laravel_project
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/laravel_project

```

# Restart Apache:

```
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
