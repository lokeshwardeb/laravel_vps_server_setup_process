on the root server i have uploaded the laravel software, when open it, it shows all the files and directories, and and when open the /public folder under it, then it shows the project


ChatGPT said:
You're seeing Laravel's files and folders listed in the browser because the server is serving from the wrong root directory.

ðŸš¨ Problem:
Your web server (Apache or Nginx) is pointing to /var/www/html/ (or wherever you uploaded Laravel), but it should only serve the /public folder of Laravel â€” not the entire project.

âœ… Correct Setup for Laravel on a VPS
Your serverâ€™s DocumentRoot (Apache) or root (Nginx) should be:

swift
Copy
Edit
/var/www/html/laravel_project/public
Instead of:

css
Copy
Edit
/var/www/html/laravel_project
ðŸ”§ Solution for Apache
Open your Apache config file:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
Change the DocumentRoot to:

apache
Copy
Edit
DocumentRoot /var/www/html/laravel_project/public
Replace laravel_project with your actual folder name.

Save and exit.

Set the correct permissions (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/laravel_project
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/laravel_project
Restart Apache:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl restart apache2
