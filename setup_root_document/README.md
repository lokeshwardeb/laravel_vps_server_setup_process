`on the root server i have uploaded the laravel software, when open it, it shows all the files and directories, and and when open the /public folder under it, then it shows the project`


ChatGPT said:
You're seeing Laravel's files and folders listed in the browser because the server is serving from the wrong root directory.

# ðŸš¨ Problem:
Your web server (Apache or Nginx) is pointing to /var/www/html/ (or wherever you uploaded Laravel), but it should only serve the /public folder of Laravel â€” not the entire project.

# âœ… Correct Setup for Laravel on a VPS
Your serverâ€™s DocumentRoot (Apache) or root (Nginx) should be:

```
/var/www/html/laravel_project/public

```
Instead of:

```
/var/www/html/laravel_project
```

# ðŸ”§ Solution for Apache
Open your Apache config file:

```
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
```

Change the DocumentRoot to:

```
DocumentRoot /var/www/html/laravel_project/public
```
Replace laravel_project with your actual folder name.

Save and exit.

# Set the correct permissions (optional but recommended):

```
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/laravel_project
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/laravel_project

```

# Restart Apache:

```
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```


# Here's the example code of the apache config file :

```apache
  GNU nano 7.2                                                                           /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf                                                                                    
<VirtualHost *:80>
        # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
        # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
        # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
        # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
        # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
        # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
        # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
        #ServerName www.example.com

        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/public

        # Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
        # error, crit, alert, emerg.
        # It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular
        # modules, e.g.
        #LogLevel info ssl:warn

        # For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
        # enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
        # include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
        # following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
        # after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
        #Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
